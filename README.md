# About

[![aste grf discord server](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/610091815236010015/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/r4Vp47G)

Game modification file for the Ragnarok Online mmorpg game created for NovaRo private server [NovaRo private server](https://www.novaragnarok.com/).

## General info

Main purpose of this grf was to create clear, performance friendly woe grf with a maximum readability, so even people who only starting playing woe can have a clear understanding what is happening around them.
Even though it’s a woe grf at the first place, it’s still fully playable for pvm.

## Compiling the grf

- Download [tokei's grf editor](https://rathena.org/board/topic/77080-grf-grf-editor/).
- Put every file in the grf container using tokei's grf editor, starting tree structure from **data/..** so the end result would look like **grf/data/...**
- Put grf file in the your client folder **usually (C:\Program Files (x86)\NovaRO)**.
- Open your **data.ini** file with any text editor tool (notepad for example). Add a new line after jobsprites.grf and before maps.grf with a number 3 in it. Change all numbers in the list so files would be numbered from 0 to 8. Save.
